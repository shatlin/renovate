# Budget Restructure Summary - Vendor Invoice Alignment

## Major Structural Changes

The budget has been completely restructured from a **room-based format** to a **trade-based format** to align with how vendors actually invoice for renovation work.

## New Structure Categories

### 1. DEMOLITION & REMOVAL
- All removal work grouped together
- Separate line items for each type of removal
- Rubble removal as standalone item

### 2. TILING (Split into FLOOR and WALL)
- **TILING - FLOOR**: All floor tiling work including screeding, main floor tiling, skirting
- **TILING - WALL**: All wall tiling separated by room

### 3. PLUMBING (Split into BATHROOM and KITCHEN)
- **PLUMBING - BATHROOM**: All bathroom plumbing work itemized
- **PLUMBING - KITCHEN**: Kitchen-specific plumbing separated

### 4. ELECTRICAL (Split into three subcategories)
- **ELECTRICAL - LIGHTING**: All light installations and wiring
- **ELECTRICAL - POWER**: Plug points, isolators, circuit breakers
- **ELECTRICAL - APPLIANCES**: Heaters, towel racks mounting and connection

### 5. PAINTING
- All painting work grouped together
- Separated by room but invoiced as one trade

### 6. CARPENTRY (Split into CABINETS and DOORS)
- **CARPENTRY - CABINETS**: All cabinet work including kitchen and bathrooms
- **CARPENTRY - DOORS**: All door replacements

### 7. FIXTURES (Split into BATHROOM and KITCHEN)
- **FIXTURES - BATHROOM**: Shower doors, mirrors, wall panels
- **FIXTURES - KITCHEN**: Counter tops, appliances

### 8. WINDOW TREATMENTS
- All blinds and decorative mirrors grouped together

### 9. PLANNING & DESIGN
- Items requiring design decisions before execution

## Key Benefits of This Structure

1. **Accurate Quotes**: Can request quotes by trade category matching vendor format
2. **Better Negotiation**: Can compare prices across vendors for specific trades
3. **Phased Execution**: Can complete work trade by trade
4. **Invoice Matching**: Budget line items now match actual invoice line items
5. **Cost Control**: Easier to track actual vs budget by trade

## Specific Improvements Based on Invoice Analysis

### More Granular Breakdown
- Separated "taking out" work from installation
- Split bathroom tiling into walls and floors
- Itemized electrical work by type (lighting vs power vs appliances)
- Separated plumbing rough-in from fixture installation

### Realistic Labour Allocations
- Demolition work properly costed separately
- Electrical work split into termination vs new installation
- Plumbing movement work itemized

### Bundling Recognition
- Kitchen sink tap included with sink
- Basin taps included with basins
- Skirting included in floor tiling contract
- Rubble removal can be bundled with tiling

## Invoice-to-Budget Mapping

Based on the analyzed invoices:

1. **Invoice #975 (R33,920)** maps to:
   - TILING category items
   - PLUMBING - BATHROOM items
   - ELECTRICAL categories
   - PAINTING items

2. **Invoice #922 (R12,800)** maps to:
   - ELECTRICAL - LIGHTING items
   - ELECTRICAL - APPLIANCES items
   - PLUMBING - BATHROOM items

3. **Quote #912 (R26,960)** maps to:
   - DEMOLITION & REMOVAL items
   - TILING - FLOOR items

## Recommendations for Using This Budget

1. **Request Quotes by Category**: Ask vendors to quote per trade category
2. **Bundle Related Work**: Consider bundling all tiling or all electrical work
3. **Phase by Trade**: Complete all demolition first, then rough-in plumbing/electrical, then finishes
4. **Track by Invoice**: Match actual invoices to these specific line items
5. **Negotiate Package Deals**: Use category totals to negotiate better rates

## Total Budget Summary by Trade

- **DEMOLITION & REMOVAL**: ~R6,000
- **TILING (FLOOR & WALL)**: ~R85,000
- **PLUMBING**: ~R20,000
- **ELECTRICAL**: ~R15,000
- **PAINTING**: ~R13,000
- **CARPENTRY**: ~R75,000
- **FIXTURES**: ~R38,000
- **WINDOW TREATMENTS**: ~R5,000

This structure now accurately reflects how vendors will bill you and makes it easier to manage the renovation project financially.
