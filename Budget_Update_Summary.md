# Renovation Budget Update Summary

## Analysis of Vendor Invoices

After analyzing 5 invoices from TL Maintenance, I've updated the renovation budget based on actual pricing patterns observed in similar completed projects.

## Key Findings from Invoices:

### 1. **Floor Tiling (Quote #912)**
- **112 sqm floor tiling**: R26,960 labour cost (fit and supply)
- This is a comprehensive quote including:
  - Removing laminate floors from bedrooms
  - Removing all tiles from passage, kitchen, and dining room
  - Screeding where floor is not level
  - Tiling all floors (112sqm)
  - Skirting tiling all around the house
  - Refuse removal

### 2. **Bathroom & Kitchen Work (Invoice #975)**
- **Tiling Labour**: R11,820 (multiple bathrooms and kitchen)
- **Plumbing Labour**: R9,800 (comprehensive bathroom plumbing)
- **Electrical Labour**: R7,000 (multiple rooms)
- **Painting Labour**: R5,800 (guest bathroom, office, kitchen, dining)

### 3. **Specialized Plumbing (Quote #915)**
- **Toilet repositioning**: R2,000
- **Washing machine plumbing**: R900

### 4. **Additional Bathroom Work (Invoice #922)**
- **Electrical**: R3,200 (lights, plugs, heaters, towel racks for 2 units each)
- **Plumbing**: R9,600 (comprehensive basin, shower, cabinet installation)

### 5. **Additional Tiling (Invoice #919)**
- **Bathroom walls and floors**: R3,600
- **Room walls**: R1,440
- **Tile removal and rubble**: R800

## Major Budget Adjustments Made:

### Underestimated Items:
1. **Bathroom Tiling**: Increased from R4,000 to R6,600 per bathroom (R3,600 labour based on actual invoice)
2. **Shower Drains**: Increased from R1,500 to R2,000 (more complex installation)
3. **Electrical Work**: Added proper costs for heaters (R2,000), towel racks (R1,200)
4. **Cabinet Installation**: Added R3,500 per bathroom (R2,000 material + R1,500 labour)
5. **Whole House Floor Tiling**: Added as separate line item at R41,960 total (R15,000 material + R26,960 labour)

### Overestimated Items:
1. **Individual Room Floor Tiling**: Set to R0 as it's included in whole house tiling contract
2. **Plumbing for Kitchen**: Reduced from R2,000 to R900 based on actual quote
3. **Kitchen Lights**: Reduced labour from R1,000 to R500

### New Items Added:
1. **Toilet Removal/Reinstallation**: R2,000 (Master Bathroom)
2. **Shower Mixers**: Included with shower setup at R4,500 total
3. **Basin and Mixer Combos**: R3,000 per bathroom
4. **Door Replacements**: R1,700 per door
5. **Comprehensive Painting**: R1,500-2,000 per room

## Cost Optimization Strategies Applied:

1. **Bundled Services**: Floor tiling for entire house as one contract saves on labour
2. **Combined Items**: Basin taps included with basin purchase
3. **Bulk Work**: Rubble removal included in tiling contracts
4. **Efficient Planning**: Electrical and plumbing rough-in done together

## Total Budget Impact:

The updated budget now reflects more realistic pricing based on actual vendor quotes. Key changes:
- More accurate labour costs based on local market rates
- Better breakdown of bundled vs. individual services
- Inclusion of previously overlooked items (doors, proper electrical fixtures)
- Realistic material costs for quality fixtures

## Recommendations:

1. **Get Multiple Quotes**: While TL Maintenance prices are used as baseline, get 2-3 quotes for major items
2. **Bundle Services**: Negotiate package deals for whole-house work (tiling, painting, electrical)
3. **Phase Work**: Consider completing bathrooms first, then bedrooms, to manage cash flow
4. **Quality Materials**: Budget includes mid-range materials; adjust up/down based on preferences
5. **Contingency**: Add 10-15% contingency for unexpected issues during renovation
